Poky source tree
------------------

-	bitbake		-	Holds all Python scripts used by the bitbake command
			bitbake/bin is placed into the PATH environmental variable so bitbake can be found

-	documentation   -       All documentation sources for the Yocto Project documentation
			Can be used to generate nice PDFs

-	meta		-	Contains the oe-core metadata
			
-	meta-poky	-	Holds the configuration for the Poky reference distribution
			local.conf.sample, bblayers.conf.sample are present here

-	meta-skeleton	- 	Contains template recipes for BSP and kernel development


-	meta-yocto-bsp  -	Maintains several BSPs such as the Beaglebone, EdgeRouter, 
			and generic versions of both 32-bit and 64-bit IA machines.

-	scripts		-	Contains scripts used to set up the environment, development tools,
			and tools to flash the generated images on the target.

-	LICENSE		-	The license under which Poky is distributed (a mix of GPLv2 and MIT).



Other directories
-----------------

-	downloads	-	downloaded upstream tarballs/git repositories of the recipes used in the build

-	sstate-cache	-	shared state cache

-	tmp		-	Holds all the build system output

			tmp/deploy/images/machine - Images are present here
			
-	cache		-	cache used by the bitbake's parser


Yocto/OpenEmbedded Build System Workflow
-----------------------------------------

1. 	Developers specify architecture, policies, patches and configuration details.

2. The build system fetches and downloads the source code from the specified location
	supports downloading tarballs and source code repositories systems such as git/svn

3. extracts the sources into a local work area

4. patches are applied

5. steps for configuring and compiling the software are run

6. installs the software into a temporary staging area
	depending on the user configuration, deb/rpm/ipk binaries are generated

7. the build system generates a binary package feed that is used to create the final root file image.

8. finally generates the file system image and a customized Extensible SDK (eSDK) for application development in parallel


Images generated by Poky Build
---------------------------------

The build process writes images out to the Build Directory inside the tmp/deploy/images/machine/ folder

1. kernel-image: 
		A kernel binary file
		The KERNEL_IMAGETYPE variable determines the naming scheme for the kernel image file.
		$ bitbake -e core-image-minimal | grep ^KERNEL_IMAGETYPE=

2. root-filesystem-image: 
		Root filesystems for the target device (e.g. *.ext3 or *.bz2 files).
		The IMAGE_FSTYPES variable determines the root filesystem image type
		$ bitbake -e core-image-minimal | grep ^IMAGE_FSTYPES=

3. kernel-modules:
		Tarballs that contain all the modules built for the kernel

4. bootloaders:
		If applicable to the target machine, bootloaders supporting the image.

symlinks
-----------
	symbolic link pointing to the most recently built file for each machine
	These links might be useful for external scripts that need to obtain  latest version of each file
	
	
Saving Disk Space while building Yocto 
=====================================

Yocto Build System can take a lot of disk space during build. But bitbake provides options to preserve disk space

You can tell bitbake to delete all the source code, build files after building a particular recipe by adding the following line in local.conf file

	INHERIT += "rm_work"

Disadvantage: Difficult to debug while build fails of any recipe.

For example, if you want to exclude bitbake deleting source code of a particular package, you can add it in RM_WORK_EXCLUDE += "recipe-name"

	E.g: RM_WORK_EXCLUDE += "core-image-minimal"
